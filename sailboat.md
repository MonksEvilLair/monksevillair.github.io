<h2>The Bright Idea</h2>

On January 1st, 2019 I got the bright idea to find a spot to park my sailboat somewhere in the San Francisco Bay and see how long I could live out there. The adventure lasted far longer than I expected and with it brought a moment of peace peppered with short periods of dread, fear, and general wetness. This is the story of a sailor, sailboat, sailrights, and <a href="https://eattheworld.bandcamp.com/track/sahalie">Sahalie</a>.

I can tell you what brought us to do this: free rent. This is the Bay Area, the highest cost of living in the world. The year before I bought my first sailboat and <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/a18930170/diy-sailboat/">set it up with an electric motor</a>, partly to escape the high rent cost and mostly for the adventure. It was and excellent choice, and I scaled a serious learning curve getting that boat sail worthy.

<h2>A Small Survey With A Big Soda</h2>

My friend <a href="http://bigsodamusic.com/">Big Soda</a>, a fellow boat dweller and an incredible musician, joined me for the first day of surveying. Armed with an 8' PVC pipe, we set to probe out our target location in San Leandro Bay - a small bay the joins the south alameda channel to the San Francisco Bay. We identified this location on USCG Chart 18649 as Part of General Anchorage 9, meaning no restrictions for anchoring. I even called around the Coast Guard Offices and confirmed this was an OK spot to anchor long term! Alright!

The only caveats - much of the area is 1ft deep at low tide, with a few deep spots at around 7ft deep. Our boats have drafts of 6ft and 5ft. From our survey we found we had a 50ft diameter valley we could park our boats in and not strike ground. This isn't enough room to have good scope, so we decided we'd set up 4 large danforth anchors on the corners of the boats. This has the major disadvantage of not allowing the boats to swing into the direction of the current, putting a lot of force on the anchors and cleats. However, this area is pretty protected, and while we were there, we made it through a couple of 30mph wind storms with no dragging. But this method of mooring was absolutely a big unknown.

<h2>Patiently Preparing Allan Holdsworth's Red Herring</h2>
We need ropes, anchors, chain, solar, reverse osmosis, inverter, internet beaming, transport boats, food, refregeration, hot water. Welll - at least some of that. Our vigor was great for our productivity - but looking back we could have used a bit more time preparing. Hard to say though, part of the fun was using my battery powered soldering iron to finish the solar system while we were anchored. I ended up strapping two huge <a href="http://www.solardesigntool.com/components/module-panel-solar/Itek-Energy/2783/iT-295-HE/specification-data-sheet.html">295W Itek Residential Solar Panels<a> to the back of my Sailboat. I got them from a local solar retailer that had a surplus of used panels - $100 with a warantee! Incredibly they fit perfectly in the back of my prius, and even came with stacking feet.

I installed a propane water heater for the shower connected to the boat water tank
